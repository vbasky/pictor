//! Engine-replica pool for concurrent serving.
//!
//! The HTTP server historically wrapped a single [`InferenceEngine`] in a
//! `tokio::sync::Mutex`, which serialized every request: a long generation
//! blocked all others for its full duration. This module replaces that single
//! mutex with a *pool* of `N` engine replicas guarded by a semaphore, so up to
//! `N` requests can generate concurrently.
//!
//! ## Why a pool works (and is safe)
//!
//! - Weights are process-global and immutable: [`InferenceEngine::from_gguf_path`]
//!   leaks the mmap and parsed `GgufFile` to `'static`, so every replica borrows
//!   the *same* `&'static GgufFile` zero-copy. The immutable, dequantized
//!   `token_embd` table is likewise shared across replicas via one `Arc<[f32]>`
//!   (see [`build_pool_from_gguf`]). Only the per-replica `KvCache` and light
//!   wrappers are duplicated.
//! - On CPU tiers (Reference / AVX / NEON), `BonsaiModel::forward` mutates only
//!   `self.kv_cache` over a shared `&dyn OneBitKernel` on immutable weights, so
//!   distinct engine instances run fully parallel.
//! - On the GPU tier (Metal / CUDA), decode funnels through a process-global
//!   singleton graph owning one KV cache and shared scratch. `N > 1` GPU
//!   replicas give *no* compute parallelism and would corrupt each other's KV,
//!   so the pool size is clamped to `1` on the GPU tier (see
//!   [`resolve_pool_size`]).
//!
//! ## Back-compatibility
//!
//! The default path wraps exactly one engine in a 1-element pool whose
//! [`EngineLease`] calls the identical `generate*` methods on the identical
//! engine. Single-request behavior — including RNG progression — is therefore
//! byte-identical to the previous single-mutex design.
//!
//! ## Lock discipline
//!
//! `idle` is a *synchronous* [`std::sync::Mutex`] held only for the duration of
//! a `pop`/`push` — never across an `.await`. Async waiting happens purely on
//! the [`tokio::sync::Semaphore`], whose permit count equals the pool size.
