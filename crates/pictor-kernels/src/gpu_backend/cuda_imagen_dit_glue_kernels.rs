//! CUDA-C kernel source for the FLUX.2 DiT "glue" ops — the per-block element-
//! wise / reduction primitives that sit between the ternary matmuls and the
//! joint flash-attention (LayerNorm, modulation, QK-RMSNorm, SwiGLU, interleaved
//! RoPE, gated residual add).
//!
//! These exist so the DiT forward can stay **GPU-resident**: today every op
//! round-trips the activation host↔device (profiling: ~96% of CUDA-API CPU time
//! is the pageable device→host downloads). With a device-side kernel for each
//! glue op, the matmul outputs feed the norms/attention without touching the
//! host. Each kernel is a **parity-first plain FP32** port of the matching CPU
//! reference in `pictor::math` (`layer_norm_inplace`, `modulate_inplace`,
//! `rms_norm_heads_inplace`, `swiglu`, `apply_rope_inplace`) and
//! `pictor::blocks::gated_residual_add` — validated at cos ≥ 0.999.
//!
//! All buffers are flat f32. No CUDA SDK headers required; `expf`/`sqrt` are
//! NVRTC built-ins. Reductions accumulate in `double` (CUDA has `double`), at
//! least as tight as the CPU f32 reference.
